            <h2>Aviation</h2>
            <p class="description">Aerial firefighting is the use of aircraft along with personel to combat wildfires. The types of aircraft used include fixed-wing aircraft and rotor wing (helicopters). Three types of aerial delivered firefighters are helitack, rappellers, and smokejumpers.  Each type has a specific set of tools in fighting forest fires that the other resources are unable to handle.  Typically aviation resources are designed to support ground resources ranging from placing firefighters in tactical location to engage the fire, suppression, and restock ground resources supplies.

                <p class="description">Helitack refers to "helicopter-delivered fire resources", and is the system of managing and using helicopters and their crews to perform aerial firefighting and other firefighting duties, primarily initial attack on wildfires. Helitack crews are used to attack a wildfire and gain early control of it, especially when inaccessibility would make it difficult or impossible for ground crews to respond in the same amount of time.</p>

                <h3 id="rappel">Rappelling</h3>
                <p class="description">Rappellers are highly skilled and qualified firefighters with the capibility of operating in modules of 2-4 crewmembers.  Teams of 2 rappellers are lowered to the ground via a rope and harness from a hovering helicopter to engage wildfires. Rappellers are utilized in difficult terrain and remote areas otherwise inacessable by hiking.  Shortly after rappellers touch ground, they are supplied with food, water, and firefighting tools by cargo boxes from the helicopter, allowing self-sufficiency for 48 hours.

                <h3 id="smokeJumping">Smoke Jumping</h3>
                <p class="description">Smokejumpers are specially trained wildland firefighters, who provide an initial attack response on wildland fires by parachuting into remote and rugged terrain. Smokejumpers commonly extinguish small fires before they become established, or can provide leadership, situational awareness, and intelligence for incoming resources on emerging incidents. Shortly after jumpers touch ground, they are then supplied by parachute with food, water, and firefighting tools, allowing self-sufficiency for 48 hours.
